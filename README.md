## Introduction
During my bachelor studies in Digital Media I developed the short animation film *Einbrechen Lohnt sich nicht (Breaking in does not pay)* with Blender 2.76. The time period to complete the film was between October and December. Through this film I also learned the basics of modeling 3D objects, storyboarding, lighting and animating.

This film is about a burglar who breaks into a house because he discovered a huge bag of money in a window. But a nasty surprise is waiting for him.

## Future

I'm still experimenting with Blender, Maya and Houdini to get better modeling and animation skills. In the future I plan to remake this film in a better quality animation, more length and more deepness.
## Notes

The movie was created with Blender 2.76.
